# weather-app

This is my Weather App project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path).

In this project I worked with APIs and asynchronous code. The page shows the weather in the city you type in the search box. You can specify your search using information from the hint (it appears when you hover over the word city). The header changes its color to match the temperature in the city, the page also shows appropriate gif image that describes the type of weather in the city. There is a toggle button to change temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
